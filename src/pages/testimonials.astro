      "Karen wrote insightful website copy to help me promote my brand. Working together she wrote up my landing page, About me section and my first ever blog post! She created a great tagline to go with my new branding 'creating visual heirlooms'. She also helped me with lots of marketing ideas and a personalised social media plan for Instagram and Facebook, which is aimed at my target market. As well as the above, Karen proofread my other website and social media copy. Being dyslexic, I find it hard to get what's in my thoughts down on paper, so her being there to proofread everything to give a boost and oomph to my presence on social media and search engines to get noticed has been amazing. I would highly recommend her services.",

Her writing is very high quality and she's great to work with - very helpful, friendly, goes above and beyond the project requirement, and genuinely cares about her clients and helping them get their business up and running.
