      <h2>Thank you for checking out my portfolio</h2>
      <p>My name is Karen. I’m a copywriter, content writer and travel junkie living in Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>
      <p>
        A few of the brands I’ve worked with since 2017 include: National Geographic Traveller (UK), Holland America
        Line, ASTA Worldwide Destinations Guide, ABTA, Postcards, and Flight Centre.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before discovering the joys of content and copywriting: I spent 15 years working on cruise ships in
        entertainment and then sales and marketing selling cruises; managed entertainment and sang in Spain; taught
        English in Italy; and backpacked around the US.
      </p>
      <p>
        I created a website about travel by cruise ship giving tips on what to do in ports, and advice on travel and
        ship life CruiseShipKaren.com
      </p>
      <p>
        Words have always been my thing, from speaking them while hosting and managing entertainment teams, singing them
        as a vocalist, teaching them while English teaching and learning other languages, to writing them to inform,
        educate, entertain, inspire and persuade.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have you covered for any type of content, weaving words to spice up the narrative of your product or story,
        researching thoroughly and creating the message you need.
